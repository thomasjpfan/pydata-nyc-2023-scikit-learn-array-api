# Scikit-learn on GPUs with Array API

[Link to slides](https://thomasjpfan.github.io/pydata-nyc-2023-scikit-learn-array-api/#1)

Scikit-learn was traditionally built and designed to run machine learning algorithms on CPUs using NumPy arrays. In version 1.3, scikit-learn can now run a subset of its functionality with other array libraries, such as CuPy and PyTorch, using the Array API standard. By adopting the standard, scikit-learn can now operate on accelerators such as GPUs. In this talk, we learn about scikit-learn's API for enabling the feature and the benefits and challenges of adopting the Array API standard.
